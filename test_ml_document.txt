Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

Key Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs. Common applications include:
- Image classification
- Spam detection
- Price prediction

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures. Examples include:
- Clustering customers into groups
- Dimensionality reduction
- Anomaly detection

3. Neural Networks
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of:
- Input layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden layers: Process information
- Output layer: Produces the final result

4. Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. Applications include:
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition

Training Process:
The training process involves feeding data to the model, calculating errors, and adjusting weights to minimize those errors. This is typically done through:
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation
- Gradient descent optimization

Conclusion:
Machine learning has revolutionized many industries and continues to advance rapidly with new techniques and applications emerging regularly.
